lThis plugin is a Death Chest system originally created for the server alliancecraft.com.br. With a complete rewrite from scratch and the adoption of new technologies, the project no longer needs to remain private. I'm making it public in case anyone wants to study how it works or adapt it for their own use.

Some parts rely on APIs from a currently private plugin, so you may need to recreate certain methods. This is not an example of clean code — the original version was quite old — which is why I chose to rebuild it entirely, adding new features and improving structure and reliability.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use it as you see fit. I hope it's useful to someone.
